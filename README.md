## Assignment 1
Information Retrieval (IR) systems play a pivotal role in extracting relevant
information from vast datasets. This assignment ventures into constructing
core IR system components, including data preprocessing, positional and un
igram inverted index creation, as well as the management of complex Boolean
and Phrase queries. It encapsulates the practical enactment of IR theories,
emphasizing the extraction and organization of meaningful insights from unstructured datasets.
